# First Step: Read and Rephrase

1. Read the problem out loud or write it in your own words
2. Can you explain to me what you understand the puzzle is asking for?
This helps catch misunderstandings early

## Day 1 Notes

1. The puzzle is asking for the final distance from the starting point to the final point
2. The final distance is the sum of the distance in the x and y directions

Input: "R2, L3"
Questions to ask:
- What does R/L mean exactly?
- Do I turn first, then move?
- When counting distance, do I count diagonal or Manhattan distance?
- Do I need to track every point I pass through, or just endpoints?
